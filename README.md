# docker-swagdevdocs
This is a small convenience environment for making changes to the shopware devdocs.

It is only useful when you have docker installed locally, but not php.
... To be honest, it is mostly an exercise in creating an alpine based docker image with php, bash and git.

This is also available as image on dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/r/3stadt/swagdevdocs/ with usage instructions.
